# Examples of the usage of our helper modules

This folder contains a set of examples, each composed of a single folder with
a simple `CMakeLists.txt` file, and in some cases some dummy|test code snipptes.
Each one of these examples should be built separately (it's not part of the
helper modules itself, but just some test scenarios and examples of its usage),
so there's no need to include them into your projects :sweat_smile:.

To check that all examples are running correctly, just use the `run.sh` script:

```bash
# Make the script runnable
chmod +x run.sh
# Run the script and see if evth. is ok
./run.sh
```
